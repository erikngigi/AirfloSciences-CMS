## United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC):
The UNFCCC, established in 1992, is a landmark international treaty aimed at addressing climate change. The convention sets the framework for global cooperation to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. Key principles include the common but differentiated responsibilities of nations, acknowledging historical contributions to emissions, and the provision of financial and technological support to developing countries.

### Paris Agreement:
Adopted in 2015 under the UNFCCC, the Paris Agreement is a groundbreaking accord that builds on the principles of the convention. Its primary goal is to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, with efforts to pursue a more ambitious target of 1.5 degrees Celsius. Key components of the Paris Agreement include:

### Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs):

Each participating country submits its NDC, outlining its commitments and strategies to reduce emissions and adapt to climate change.
- Global Stocktake:Regular assessments of collective progress towards the agreement's goals, providing a basis for increased ambition over time.
- Financial Support: Developed countries commit to mobilizing financial resources to assist developing nations in both mitigating and adapting to climate change.
- Technology Transfer: Facilitates the transfer of environmentally sound technologies from developed to developing countries to support sustainable development.
- Adaptation and Loss & Damage: Emphasizes the importance of adaptation measures to cope with the impacts of climate change and addresses the issue of loss and damage associated with these impacts.
- Transparency and Accountability: Establishes a robust framework for transparency and accountability, ensuring that nations are held accountable for their commitments.
- Global Cooperation: Encourages collaborative efforts, fostering a sense of shared responsibility in the global fight against climate change.

### Conclusion:
The UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement are cornerstones of international efforts to combat climate change. By fostering collaboration, setting clear targets, and emphasizing the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, these agreements provide a comprehensive framework for a sustainable and collective response to the urgent global challenge of climate change.
