### Global Stocktake and Mid-Point Assessment

* Accelerating the energy transition and reducing emissions before 2030.
* Overhauling climate finance, ensuring fulfillment of previous commitments and framing a new financial deal.
* Placing nature, people, lives, and livelihoods at the core of climate action.
* Mobilizing for the most inclusive COP ever.

### Vision and Action Agenda

The Presidency outlines a three-fold vision for COP 28: a negotiated outcome, an action agenda, and a call to action. The action agenda encompasses fast-tracking the energy transition, transforming climate finance, prioritizing nature and people, and ensuring inclusivity.
