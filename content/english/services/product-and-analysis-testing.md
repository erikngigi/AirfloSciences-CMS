description : "Product testing is a systematic process of evaluating and examining a product's performance, quality, safety, and compliance with specified standards or requirements. This process involves subjecting the product to various tests, measurements, and assessments to ensure that it meets predefined criteria and performs as intended. Product testing is conducted to verify the reliability, durability, and safety of a product before it is introduced to the market, aiming to identify and rectify any defects or issues that could impact its functionality or pose risks to users."
