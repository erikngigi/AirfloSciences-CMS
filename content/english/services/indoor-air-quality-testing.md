description : "Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) testing is a comprehensive assessment of the air quality within a building or enclosed space. This testing involves the measurement and analysis of various indoor air pollutants to evaluate the overall health and comfort of the indoor environment. The goal is to identify potential sources of pollution, assess pollutant levels, and ensure that indoor air meets established standards for occupant well-being. IAQ testing is particularly important in homes, offices, schools, healthcare facilities, and other indoor environments where people spend a significant amount of time."
