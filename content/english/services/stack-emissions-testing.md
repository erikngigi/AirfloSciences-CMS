description : "Stack Emission Testing, also known as stack testing or source testing, is a process that involves the collection and analysis of emissions released from industrial stacks or chimneys. The goal is to measure the quantity and composition of specific pollutants being discharged into the atmosphere. This testing is crucial for assessing compliance with environmental regulations, ensuring air quality standards, and identifying potential environmental and health risks associated with industrial emissions."

### Key Aspects Tested in Stack Emissions Testing
{{% expand "Particulate Matter (PM) Sampling" %}}
Stack emissions testing involves sampling and analyzing particulate matter, which includes solid particles and liquid droplets emitted into the air. Methods such as isokinetic sampling or continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMS) are employed to measure the concentration of PM.

{{% expand "Gas Analysis (NOx, SO2, CO, VOCs)" %}}
Stack emissions testing includes the measurement of various gases such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Gas analyzers, including infrared analyzers, chemiluminescent analyzers, and flame ionization detectors, are used to quantify gas concentrations.

{{% expand "Opacity Testing" %}}
Opacity testing assesses the degree to which visible emissions, such as smoke or dust, obscure light. This visual assessment helps evaluate the overall opacity of emissions and is often conducted using specialized equipment, such as opacity meters or continuous opacity monitoring systems (COMS).

{{% expand "Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide Levels" %}}
Measurement of oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) levels is essential in stack emissions testing. These measurements help assess combustion efficiency and the completeness of the combustion process. Oxygen analyzers and infrared gas analyzers are commonly used for this purpose.
